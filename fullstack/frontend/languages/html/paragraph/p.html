        Introduction: As the title suggests, the application will be a web-based application for visually impaired persons using IVR- Interactive voice response, thus enabling everyone to control their mail accounts using their voice only and to be able to read,send, and perform all the other useful tasks. The system will prompt the user with voice commands to perform certain action and the user will respond to the same. The main benefit of this system is that the use of keyboard is completely eliminated, the user will have to respond through voice and mouse click only.
Now you must be thinking that how will a blind person will see the correct position on the screen for doing mouse clicks. But this system will perform actions based on the clicks only that is left click or right click, it does not depends on the portion of the screen where the cursor is placed before the click giving user the freedom to click blindly anywhere on the screen.
Design: The design of this project is divided into three phases as described below:

        Design: The design of this project is divided into three phases as described below:

UI design: In this phase the UI or the user interface of the project is developed. That is, the designing of the web pages which the user will use to interact.
Database design: The database is considered to be the main pillars of every project. In our application, database is used to store user details such as name, age etc. Database here is also used to keep information about the emails sent or received or in draft. The complete proposed design of the database is shown in the ER-diagram below. This ER-diagram shows all the tables with all fields and also relationship between different tables.
System design: In this phase a complete flow diagram of the working system is designed. This flow diagram will show the details of all the events like actions to be performed for an event.

        Login: This is the very first page and will ask user to enter login credentials. It will prompt user with voice command to enter user name. After receiving user name it will prompt again for password. After receiving all of the details from user, it will encrypt and check the validity of the details entered by user. If valid, then user will be redirected to dashboard else will be sent back to login page.
</p>
<p>     Dashboard: After successful login, user will be redirected to this page and this is the main page from where user can perform all the activities like, compose a new mail, check inbox, save to draft etc.
Below steps specifies the operation that will be executed based on a specific click of mouse button. As the user is supposed to be blind, so it is allowed to click blindly anywhere on the screen:
