<h>External CSS</h>
<p>With external CSS, youâ€™ll link your web pages to an external .css file, which can be created by any text editor in your device (e.g., Notepad++).
This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. By editing one .css file, you can change your entire site at once.</p>
